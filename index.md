Australian-Chinese tenor _Kang Wang_ is one of the most sought-after young lyric tenors in the opera world. He is a former member of the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program of the Metropolitan Opera and a finalist in the 2017 Cardiff Singer of the World competition.

In the 2021-2022 season, Mr. Wang makes his house and role debut at Washington National Opera as Ferrando in Così fan tutte. He also makes his house debut at Seattle Opera as Rodolfo in La bohème, returns to Opera Australia in the same role, and returns to Opera Queensland as Alfredo in La traviata. In concert, he joins the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra for a performance celebrating the Chinese New Year and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra for a concert of arias.

Last season, Mr. Wang joined Opera Queensland in a performance celebrating the company’s 40th anniversary and for a solo recital with pianist John Woods. Engagements canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic included performances at the Metropolitan Opera as Tamino in Die Zauberflöte, at Opera Australia as Alfredo, at Kentucky Opera as Rodolfo in La bohème, and at Washington Concert Opera as Gabriele Adorno in Simon Boccanegra. On the concert stage, he had been scheduled to sing Verdi’s Messa da Requiem with the Louisiana Philharmonic and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra.
