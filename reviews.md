_“Kang Wang has a herculean voice for the ages, striding through his arias with a rare ease and sheen.”_

-- The Australian

_“… a most beautiful voice that has been likened to liquid gold. It is a near-perfect instrument that is an absolute joy to listen to, matching a powerful and dramatic stage presence.”_

-- Limelight Magazine

"Kang Wang, making his company début, was a revelation as Rodolfo. It’s little wonder that this young Australian tenor, born in China to opera-singer parents, is turning heads around the world. Singing and acting with extraordinary freedom and poise, he was a most plausible poet and lover. ‘Che gelida manina’ – clearly Wang’s kind of music – revealed a thrilling tenor, with real ping at the top, but there is also a pleasing baritonal quality to this arresting voice. Opera Australia may have just found its next real thing."

"Kang Wang makes a striking Opera Australia debut in La bohème"

-- Backtrack

"Kang Wang thrills as Rodolfo in an impressive house debut."

-- Limelight Magazine

"Kang Wang’s full lyric tenor suited with Requiem perfectly, bringing Verdi’s operatic style to the religious work. His Ingemisco emanated from the stage with exquisite legato and tasteful phrasing. His trio with Pancella and bass Michael Dean in the Lux aeterna wove a wonderful web of somber melancholy."

-- Eugene Scene

"Opera North debutant Kang Wang, as Tamino, impresses immediately with the contrasting fevered dread and love-struck lyricism of his opening arias, delivered with dramatic authority and musicality. As a Mozartian hero, his portrayal carries a special charge throughout." 

-- The State of Hearts UK


"Kang Wang, new to Leeds, offers a stylish Tamino, full-bodied at the start, but tenderer with Pamina and sensitive in ensemble."

-- York Press


“Kang Wang was one of the main prize finalists in the Cardiff Singer of the World in 2017 and it’s easy to see and hear why in playing the role of Alfredo.
There is an exceptional quality in his voice and while there is clearly power and control, he exhibits a soft tenderness in many of the intimate sections. In many of the quieter passages he is capable of judging perfectly the volume needed to express his character’s emotional state against the needs of clarity for his audience.
Listening to him you feel certain that his talent and tone are very special, which, alongside his acting ability here, made for a very convincing portrayal of his character.”

-- Behind Herras


“Young Australian-Chinese tenor Kang Wang was a finalist in the Cardiff Singer of the World last year. His range is delivered smoothly throughout, especially across the break, and there is an admirable warmth of tone in his quieter passages as the love-sick Alfredo. This is a voice which will be welcome in the world’s great opera houses for many years to come.”

"The vocal part of the concert was opened by Kang Wang by the performance of the aria of Edgardo from the third act of the opera Lucia di Lammermoor by G. Donizetti. The tenor of a very beautiful, velvet timbre sounded, voluminous and full, conquering the audience with impeccable sound. The artist is sincere in conveying emotions in his open appeal to the viewer, calling for empathy. It was in this vein that Alfred's aria was performed by Kang Wang from the second act of the opera La Traviata by G. Verdi. In famous, famous interpretations of the performance of this part of the opera, the artist managed to bring his own reading, having conducted this aria in a sincere state of undisturbed happiness, without excessive exaltation, in a confidential manner of communicating with the viewer. This line of performance was continued by the singer in the aria of Rudolph from the opera La Boheme by D. Puccini.

In the second section of the concert, Kang Wang performed the arias of the romantic plan. This is the aria of Werther from the opera of the same name J. Massenet and Cavatina Romeo from the opera "Romeo and Juliet" by S. Gounod. The peculiarity of the interpretation of the famous arias of the world tenor repertoire from Kang Wang can be called a special confession of performance, when the artist proceeds from purely personal, deeply personal experiences, putting his "I" in the center of the narrative. The singer, voluntarily or unwittingly, was the bearer of the basic idea of Confucianism transmitted by means of European culture.

Tools for the transfer of meanings are in the arsenal of the artist at the highest level. This is the perfect vocal technique, and the beautiful language of the performed work, and it's Italian, French. At the second solo concert of Kang Wang on January 4, the audience heard a perfectly flawless Russian language in the performance of the romances of P. Tchaikovsky and S. Rachmaninov. This happens rarely and is especially pleasant for us!"

"Kang Wang, another newcomer to the company, accomplished what tenors in the role of Don Ottavio rarely do – he gave the audience a believable understanding of why he was the grand Donna Anna’s fiancé. Usually the character comes across as a bit of a milksop, trailing in the formidable lady’s wake for no obvious reason, but he sang and acted the part in a manner that conveyed a strength that frequently is lost. In a spot or two his phrasing was not of the smoothest, but seeing this role in the hands of a singer who could make something of the part was such a refreshing change that it didn’t much matter."

"The entire cast is worthy of kudos, but the leading roles are played by the best in opera today. Kang Wang who dazzled Austin audiences in LA BOHEMÈ last season returns to play the playboy Duke with his gorgeous tenor and depth of character. He takes the iconic "La donna è mobile" from frivolous to haunting in the final act."

-- Broadway World


"As the Duke, Kang Wang applied his thick tenor sound and confident stage charisma to every note from the opening party sequence to the closing “La Donna È Mobile,” one of Verdi’s most enduring tunes. "
